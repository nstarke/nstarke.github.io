## Introduction

I recently acquired an ONN Laptop. This is a brand of laptop sold exclusively through Walmart in the US.

I decided to investigate this laptop because I had a suspicion it's BIOS was not particularly locked down. Turns out my suspicion was well founded; this article will describe the various configuration settings made available through BIOS on the ONN Laptop.

I was unable to conduct extensive vulnerability testing with this laptop as by setting a particular BIOS option, through the built-in BIOS Configuration Utility nonetheless, I bricked the laptop. Read the analysis section for more information, where I also list out the various attacker vectors I identified.

## Analysis

Through the configuration menus listed below it is possible to enable Intel DCI without making any custom modifications to the BIOS image using a tool such as `RU.efi`. This means it is possible to enable Intel DCI without disabling and re-enabling Secure Boot. I was able to connect the laptop to a host system running Intel System Debugger (legacy) and successfully halt the laptop's processor and see the system state, as well as perform some rudimentary debugging at this level.

The interesting functions of the BIOS - specifically the network enabled capabilities, do not seem to function properly. Every time I tried setting a boot URI in the UEFI HTTP IPv4 configuration menu, the option value reset to blank every time I saved the BIOS configuration. 

Several other options, such as `ASF Support` in `Advanced / AMT Configuration` also displayed this behavior. When I set `ASF Support` to enabled, saved, and then exited the BIOS, on the very next entry into BIOS the `ASF Support` option was set to disabled. 

I was able to get the WiFi configuration to successfully authenticate to the WiFi network, but the device never responded to ICMP or other IP level messages. It seems like there is some Layer 2 attack surface here in terms of authenticating to the WiFi access point, which may be the only "remote" attack vector. This still would require local proximity to the device.

Other interesting input includes the `Cert Enrollment` option in the `Advanced / TLS Configuration` menu. This allows certificates to be loaded from USB storage, which invites some unique opportunities, given physical access.

There of course are the UEFI NVRAM variables as potential vectors to supply malicious input. I did not explore this avenue beyond setting options in the BIOS configuration utility.

Also worth noting is that the `Firmware Configuration` Menu contains an option for `Ignore Policy Update` - when I set this to be the configured option, the laptop would no longer boot, not even to BIOS, resulting in a bricked laptop.  It looks like the BIOS manufacturer attempted to warn users about setting this option, but it was not clear to me that setting this option as the configured value would have the effect of bricking the laptop. 

I might have been able to restore the laptop to a functional state if I had made a back up of the SPI ROM prior to testing; I did not do this, foolishly not thinking that there could be any way to permanently brick the laptop through BIOS shy of powering off the device during a firmware update. Certainly I did not anticipate a configurable option placing the laptop in such a state.

The best advice I can offer users of this laptop is that they set the `User Password` under the `Security` Menu - this will require a password to POST as well as access BIOS settings. I'm not convinced that there isn't a way to bypass this authentication mechanism, but it is better than nothing. Like most devices, physical access to this device essentially means game over in terms of security - by allowing debug capabilities it is possible to manipulate the laptop at the platform level.

Below is a run through of the BIOS Configuration Utility menus.  Note that except for one or two special instances, the values in the images for the various settings are the default values.  

## Main Menu

![ONN BIOS Main Menu](/images/0039/0039-onn-bios-main-screen.png "ONN BIOS Main Menu")

This is the first screen the user is greeted with upon entering system BIOS. The user can enter the system BIOS by pressing the `Delete` button at the ONN splash screen. It contains version information for the currently install BIOS image.

There are six total menus:
